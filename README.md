# CUAS-UTM-integration-simulation
Simulation and evaluation tool for the integration of the CUAS 

This repository contains a tool for experiminting the model described in the paper titled Integrating Counter-Drone Systems into UTM for Cooperative vs. Uncooperative Identification, Abdulhadi Shoufan, Ruba Alkadi, 

The simulation tool is designed using Stateflow in a simulink environment. 

A test.sdd file is used to define and initialize simulation parameters. 
please load the test.sdd file and the CUAS_chart_modified.slx in a single path and add the path to the MATLAB environment. 

The rest is self-explanatory.
